wview HTML Template Skin HOWTO
------------------------------

-- Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective is to allow contributors to submit new web site skins which 
support standard or extended data (UV, ET and Solar Radiation) as well as 
Imperial (US) or Metric units. To that end, each skin should provide a 
"standard" and "plus" subdirectory containing templates and the appropriate 
"html-templates.conf", "images.conf/images-metric.conf", "images-user.conf",
"graphics.conf" and "post-generate.sh" files. See the "classic" skin in the 
wview distribution for an example implementation.

-- Minimum Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) index.htx and/or index-day.htx/index-night.htx
    This is the home page template.  If "day/night" are provided and 
    listed in "html-templates.conf", wview will generate based on if it 
    is day time or night time.

2) html-templates.conf
    This specifies the html template files to generate. Contents are up 
    to the skin designer.

3) images.conf/images-metric.conf
    These are the US/Metric configuration files containing the images to 
    be generated. wviewhtmlconfig copies the appropriate file based on 
    the units selection during execution of "wviewconfig". Contents are 
    up to the skin designer but both files should be provided.

4) images-user.conf (can be empty)
    Allows new images to be designed and included in skins.

5) graphics.conf (can be empty if default colors are desired)
    Allows custom definition of colors and sizes for wview graphics.

6) post-generate.sh
    Allows custom post-generation actions to be defined by skin designers.

7) Standard and Extended Data Support
    Each skin should have a "standard" and "plus" subdirectory with 
    appropriate template and config files for each mode.

8) Static File Support
    Each skin may have a "static" subdirectory under <your_skin_name>. Files
    in this directory will be copied to the HTML destination directory (i.e.,
    /var/wview/img) once when wviewhtmlconfig is run. Examples include page
    backgrounds, css files, etc.

Note: Skins will be located at: 
      .../wview-x.y.z/examples/html/<your_skin_name>
      The wviewhtmlconfig script will allow selection of skin and copy 
      templates and config files appropriately if the skin is organized 
      as described above.
      To add your skin to wviewhtmlconfig, look around line 95 for:
        "classic" )
            echo "Site skin $SITE_SKIN selected..."
            ;;
      and add a block for your skin below it as:
        "classic" )
            echo "Site skin $SITE_SKIN selected..."
            ;;
        "<your_skin_name>" )
            echo "Site skin $SITE_SKIN selected..."
            ;;


-- Submission for Inclusion In wview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tar the <your_skin_name> directory up and send it to me at 
mteel2005@gmail.com.  I will test it and if all is good, include it in 
"wviewhtmlconfig" and the next wview release.
